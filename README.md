#### Rules

This is a game against computer. Player's field is on the right, computer's is on the left.

The BattleShip identifies a miss with a dot, a hit with a cross, and also status of any movie is declared under the field. 
You can not hit the same spot twice.

Once a player sinks all of the opponent's ships, the game is over!

#### Improvements
1. Render Field by algorythm.
2. Make Computer's Moves smarter.
